  - How did you know exactly what I wanted? Please get out of my head.
  - ohhhhHHHHH YEAH BABY WE'RE GOING.
  - '*incomprehensibler revving noises*'
  satisfiedResponseList:
  - Thanks for the drink, it made my decade.
  - Despite your looks, you seem to know what you're doing.
  - Thank you. Just... thank you.
  neutralResponseList:
  - I can tell you tried but...
  - It'll do. It's not like there's anything better in my life.
  - Try harder.

  - I mean, I don't hate it as much as I hate my son.
  - If I weren't a rabbit, I'd be asking for a refund.
  - Honestly, this is more disappointing than I was to my father.
  hateResponseList:
  - You absolute useless heathen. Do you even know what you just poured?
  - Do you find it funny to give something like this to a man in agony?
  - I have stared into the depths of hell and this is worse.
  connectorsList:
  - I think I might need a couple more.
  - Hey bud, where do you think you're going? The night's not over yet.
  - I know my consequences will follow me in the future, but maybe just one more
    drink.
